# 2PlayerSnakeArduinoGame
This is a 2-Player snake game created for playing on any video device (composite cable) from your arduino. This game is created mostly as a fun project, learning a lot about the arduino's limitations.

This game requires the TVout Library to display on screens: https://code.google.com/p/arduino-tvout/

How to control the snakes:
By using either demultiplexers or just 12 ports on the arduino board, you may use selfmade controllers to navigate (Don't worry, not too hard to make.)
